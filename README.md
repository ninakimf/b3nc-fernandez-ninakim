### HTML and CSS
Discussions and coding activities are okay, but I think more coding activiteis should be done so that we could apply more the skills and knowledge we're learning. The pacing of the lecture is good. I was able to pick up everything but if there are more discussions, my attention is not as whole as I have if coding exercises are given since I have a very short attention span. With the exercises, I get to understand the course more and apply it immediately.
